# library

Small library website made using Javascript as part of the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-library). Since I already "surpassed" this level, I took it as a chance to brush up on my Javascript and play around a little bit with Bootstrap, since up 'til now I made all my styling from scratch.  
It was an interesting experience, I can certainly see why it's popular. I will be using it for all my future projects to familiarize myself with it.
